# Normal distribution

## Basics 

$\mu$ and $\sigma$ determine the center and spread of the distribution.

The empirical rule holds for all normal distributions:

(1) 68% of the area under the curve lies between $(\mu-\sigma,\mu+\sigma)$.

(2) 95% of the area under the curve lies between $(\mu-2\sigma,\mu+2\sigma)$.

(2) 99.7% of the area under the curve lies between $(\mu-3\sigma,\mu+3\sigma)$.


## Percentile

A percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls. 

For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found. 

For normal distribution, 

-3 $\sigma$ is the 0.13th percentile (i.e., $\frac{100-99.7}{2}=0.15$); 

-2 $\sigma$ is the 2.28th percentile ((i.e., $\frac{100-95}{2}=2.50$)); 

-1$\sigma$ is the 15.87th percentile (i.e., $\frac{100-68}{2}=16$); 

0 $\sigma$ is 50th percentile.

+2 $\sigma$ is the 97.72nd percentile (i.e., $100-\frac{100-95}{2}=100-2.5=97.50$); 

+3 $\sigma$ is the 99.87th percentile (i.e., $100-\frac{100-99.70}{2}=100-0.15=99.85$). 

This is related to the 68-95-99.7 rule or the three-sigma rule.

(Note that, it is _related_, not _direct_ 68-95-99.7 rule, which is about symmetric situations. See the figure above)


## Confidence intervals for normal distributions


$$\bar{X} \pm Z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
where,

$\bar{X}$ is the mean

$Z$ is the Z value (see the table below)

$\sigma$ is the standard deviation 

$n$ is the number of observations

(We can see the connection between this formula and information shown in the _Basics_ section.)

$$\begin{bmatrix}
Confidence \; Levels & Z \\
80  & 1.282 \\
85 & 1.440 \\
90 & 1.645 \\
95 & 1.960 \\
99 & 2.576 \\
99.5 & 2.807 \\
99.9 & 3.291 \end{bmatrix}$$
