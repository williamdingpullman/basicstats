In layman terms, it is a number that has a certain probability attached to it. 1.1.2 Permutation An ordered arrangement of a set of objects is known as a permutation. e.g., The number of permutations of n distinguishable objects is \\(n!\\). e.g., The number of permuations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is \\[_{n}P_r=\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\] 1.1.3 Combinations If the order of the objects is not important, then one may simply be interested in the number of combinations. \\[\\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\] 1.1.4 Partitioning The number of ways of partitioning a set of n objects into k cells with \\(r_1\\) objects into the first cell, \\(r_2\\) in the second cell, and so forth is \\[\\frac{n!}{r_1! r_2! ...r_k!}\\] 1.2 Discrete Random Variables 1.2.1 Binomial \\[X\\sim BIN(n,p)\\] \\[\\binom{n}{x}P^x(1-P)^{n-x}\\] mean: \\(np\\) variance: \\(npq\\) Support (or, possible values): \\(0, 1, 2,...n\\) (Note that, Bernoulli is written as \\(BIN(1, p)\\)) 1.2.2 Poisson \\[X \\sim POI(\\mu)\\] \\[\\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^x}{x!}\\] mean: \\(\\mu\\) variance: \\(\\mu\\) Support (or, possible values): \\(0, 1, 2,...\\) (i.e., 0+ positive integer; or Natural number) 1.3 Continuous Random Variables 1.3.1 Uniform \\[X \\sim UNIF(a,b)\\] \\[\\frac{1}{b-a}\\] Mean: \\(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\) Variance: \\(\\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\\) Support (or, possible values): \\(a&lt;x&lt;b\\) 1.3.2 Exponential \\[X \\sim EXP(\\theta)\\] \\[\\frac{1}{\\theta} e^{-x/\\theta}\\] Mean: \\(\\theta\\) Variance: \\(\\theta^2\\) Support (or, possible values): \\(0&lt;x\\) 1.3.3 Normal \\[X\\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\] \\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma})^2}\\] Mean: \\(\\mu\\) Variance\" \\(\\sigma^2\\) Support (or, possible values): \\(-\\infty&lt;x&lt;+\\infty\\) 1.4 Large Sample Theory 1.4.1 Convergence in distribution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers \\[\\bar{X} \\rightarrow \\mu \\; \\; \\; (n \\rightarrow \\infty)\\] \\[Var(\\bar{X})=Var(\\frac{1}{n}(X_1+...+X_n))=\\frac{1}{n^2}Var(X_1+...+X_n)=\\frac{n \\sigma^2}{n^2}=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\] 1.4.2 Weak law There are two different versions of the Law of Large Numbers: Strong law of large numbers and Weak law of large numbers. The weak law of large numbers: The sample average converges in probability towards the expected value. \\[\\bar{X_n} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mu \\; \\; \\; (n \\rightarrow \\infty)\\] This, for any positive number \\(\\epsilon\\) \\[lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} Pr(|\\bar{X_n}-\\mu|&gt;\\epsilon)=0\\] 1.4.3 Strong law http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu/teaching/fall12/handouts/LLN.pdf The sequence of sample mean \\(\\bar{X}_n\\) converges to \\(\\mu\\) almost surely. \\[\\bar{X_n} \\xrightarrow{a.s.} \\mu \\; \\; \\; (n \\rightarrow \\infty)\\] This is, \\[Pr(lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\bar{X_n}=\\mu)=1\\] 1.4.4 Central limit theorem If \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) is a random sample from a distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2 &lt; \\infty\\), then the limiting distribution of \\[Z_n=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i - n\\mu}{\\sqrt{n} \\sigma}\\] is the standard normal, \\(Z_n \\xrightarrow{d} Z \\sim N(0,1)\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\). 1.4.4.1 Bernoulli law of large number \\(\\hat{p}_n=\\frac{Y_n}{n}\\) converges stochasticalltly to \\(p\\) as \\(n\\) approchaes infinity. For example, if a coin is tossed repeatedly, and \\(A=\\{H\\}\\), then the successive relative frequencies of A correspond to a sequence of random variables that will converge stochastically to \\(p=1/2\\). 1.4.4.2 Normal approximation to Binomial \\[Z_n=\\frac{Y_n-np}{\\sqrt{npq}} \\xrightarrow{d} Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\] Example: The probability that a basketball player hits a shot is \\(p=0.5\\).

["section-1.html", "Chapter 2 556 2.1 Statistics and Sampling Distributions 2.2 Point Estimation 2.3 Sufficient and completeness", " Chapter 2 556 2.1 Statistics and Sampling Distributions 2.1.1 Statistics 2.1.1.1 Definition of Statistic P.264 A fucntion of observable random variables, \\(T=t(X_1, ... X_n)\\), which does not depend on any unknown parameters is called statistic. For example, let \\(X_1, ..., X_n\\) represent a random sample from a population with \\(pdf \\;f(x)\\). The sample mean provides an example of a statistic with the function \\[t(x_1,...,x_n)=(x_1+...+x_n)/n\\] This statistic usually is denoted by \\[\\bar{X}=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{X_i}{n}\\] When a random sample is observed, the value of \\(\\bar{X}\\), computed from the data, usually is denoted by lower case \\(\\bar{x}\\). \\[\\bar{x}=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{x_i}{n}\\] 2.1.1.2 Sample and parameters P.265 If \\(X_1,..., X_n\\) denotes a random sample from \\(f(x)\\) with \\(E(X)=\\mu\\) and \\(var(X)=\\sigma^2\\), then \\[E(\\bar{X})=\\mu\\] \\[Var(\\bar{X})=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\] Example: A random sample of size \\(n\\) from a Bernoulli distribution \\(X_i \\sim BIN(1,p)\\). We know Bernoulli has \\(\\mu=p\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 =pq\\). In this case, the sample mean is \\[\\bar{X}=Y/n=\\hat{p}\\] Thus, \\[E(\\hat{p})=p\\] \\[Var (\\hat{p})=\\frac{pq}{n}\\] Thus, sample mean is the unbiased estimate for the population mean. However, the variance of the mean is not equal to population variance. That lead to definition of sample variance. P.266 Sample variance: \\[S^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2\\] \\[E(S^2)=\\sigma^2\\] (Question: does it mean that sample varaince is an unbiased estimator of population variance?) 2.1.2 \\(\\chi^2, t, F, beta\\) 2.1.2.1 \\(\\chi^2\\) P.271 If \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) denotes a random sample from \\(N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), then \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(X_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sim x^2(n)\\] \\[\\frac{n(\\bar{X}-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\sim x^2(1)\\] \\[\\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\chi^2(n-1)\\] (Thus, we can see this is a bit weired, as the numerator is \\(\\bar{X}\\) is from the sample, whereas \\(\\sigma^2\\) is from the population. Thus, assume we know \\(\\sigma^2\\)?) Thus, we can \\[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2}{\\sigma^2}\\sim \\chi^2(n-1)\\] (You can compare \\(\\bar{X}\\) with \\(\\mu\\), we can see the only difference is that the \\(\\chi^2\\) has one less degree of freedom because we use this degree of freedom to calculate the mean.) For the mean and variance of \\(\\chi^2\\): Assume that \\[X \\sim x^2(v)\\] \\[mean:v\\] \\[variance: 2v\\] 2.1.2.2 \\(t\\) Definition \\[t(k)=\\frac{N(0,1)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\chi^2(k)}{k}}}\\] Property 1 t distribution is symmetrical. Given that t distribution is symmetrical, we can get \\[H(-c)=1-H(c)\\] Property 2 t distribution has heavier tails than the normal. My note: t distribution only has a parameter of \\(k\\), which is determined by the \\(\\chi^2\\)’s degree of freedom. Of course, \\(\\chi^2\\) also only has one parameter, namely the degree of freedom. 2.1.2.3 \\(F\\) If \\(V_1 \\sim \\chi^2(v_1)\\) and \\(V_2 \\sim \\chi^2(v_2)\\) are independent, then the random variable \\[\\frac{V_1/v_1}{V_2/v_2}\\sim F(v_1,v_2)\\] 2.1.2.4 Beta If \\(X \\sim F(v_1, v_2)\\) \\[Y=\\frac{(v_1/v_2)X}{1+(v_1/v_2)X} \\sim Beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\\] 2.1.3 Large-sample approximations P.280 If \\(Y_v \\sim x^2(x)\\), then \\[Z_v =\\frac{Y_v-v}{\\sqrt{2v}} \\xrightarrow{d} Z \\sim N(0,1)\\] (The proof is based on CLT. In addition, as disscused above, we can get chi-square from normal distributions.) 2.2 Point Estimation 2.2.1 Method of moments estimators 2.2.1.1 Definition about moments (chapter 2) P.73 THe kth moment about the origin of a random variable \\(X\\) is \\[\\mu^{&#39;}_k=E(X^k)\\] and the kth moment about the mean is \\[\\mu_k=E[X-E(X)]^k=E(X-\\mu)^k\\] Thus,\\(k=E(X^k)\\) may be considered as the \\(k\\)th moment of \\(X\\) or the first moment of \\(X^k\\). The first moment about the mean is zero, \\[\\mu_1=E[X-E(X)]=E(X)-E(X)=0\\] The second moment about the mean is the variance, \\[\\mu_2=E[(X-\\mu)^2]=\\sigma^2\\] Note that the definition of variance: P.73 \\[Var(X)=E[(X-\\mu)^2]\\] ( Note: Based on the information above, it seems important to understand the difference between the moment of the origin and the moment of the mean. ) 2.2.1.2 Definition Based on the last chapater (i.e., Chapter 8), sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) is an estimator of the population mean \\(\\mu\\). A more general approach, which produced estimators known as the method of moments estimators(MMEs) , can be developed. If \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) is a random sample from \\(f(x; \\theta_1,...,\\theta_k)\\), the first \\(k\\) sample moments are given by \\[M_j^{&#39;}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^j}{n}\\] where, \\[j=1,2,...k\\] Example 1: P.291 Consider a random sample from a distribution with two unknown parameters, the mean \\(\\mu\\) and the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). We know from earlier considerations that \\(\\mu=\\mu^{&#39;}_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2=E(X^2)-\\mu^2=\\mu_2^{&#39;}-(\\mu^{&#39;}_1)^2\\). Thus, \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\mu_2^{&#39;}-(\\mu^{&#39;}_1)^2=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2}{n}-\\bar{X}^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(X_i-\\bar{X})^2}{n}\\] (Thus, we can see that the MME estimation of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is not the same as the definition of sample variance \\(S^2\\). \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{n-1}{n}S^2\\). So, the MME estimator is not an unbiased one?) Example 2: P.292 If a sample is from a Gamma distribution \\(X_i \\sim GAM(\\theta,k)\\), and we want to estimate the \\(\\theta\\) and \\(k\\). We know that for Gamma distribution, the mean is \\(k\\theta\\), and the variance is \\(k\\theta^2\\). We also know that \\[\\mu_1^{&#39;}=\\mu=k\\theta\\] and \\[\\mu_2^{&#39;}= \\sigma^2+\\mu^2= k\\theta^2+k^2\\theta^2=k\\theta^2(1+k)\\]. Thus, we can get \\[\\bar{X}=k\\theta\\] \\[\\sum \\frac{X_i^2}{n}=k\\theta^2(1+k)\\] Thus, we can get \\[\\hat{\\theta}=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(X_i-\\bar{X})^2}{n \\bar{X}}=\\frac{(n-1)/n S^2}{\\bar{X}}\\] \\[\\hat{k}=\\frac{\\bar{X}}{\\hat{\\theta}}\\] ( Note: To sum up, (1) we know how to calculate moments based on sample. And, (2) we know that connection between moment and parameter of mean and variance. Thus, combining (1) and (2), we can get the estimators for the parameters. ) 2.2.1.3 Property The joint MGF of (\\(X_1, ..., X_n\\)) is defined as \\(M(t_1,...,t_n)=E(e^{\\sum_{i=1}^nt_iX_i})\\) When \\(X_1, ..., X_n\\) are independent if and only if \\[M(t_1,...,t_n)=\\prod_{i=1}^n M_{X_i}(t_i)\\] where \\(M_{X_i}(t_i)\\) is the MGF of \\(X_i\\) 2.2.1.4 Well-known MGF Bernoulli with success probability \\(p\\): \\(1-p+pe^t\\) Binomial \\(Bin(n,p)\\): \\((1-p+pe^t)^n\\) Poisson \\(POI(\\lambda)\\): \\(e^{\\lambda(e^t-1)}\\) Normal \\(N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\): \\(e^{\\mu t+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2t^2}\\) Gamma \\(GAM(\\theta,k)\\): \\((1-\\theta t)^{-k}\\) Two special cases: Chi-square \\(\\chi^2(v) =GAM(2,\\frac{v}{2})\\): \\((1-2t)^{-\\frac{v}{2}}\\) Exponential \\(EXP(\\theta)=GAM(\\theta,1)\\): \\((1-\\theta t)^{-1}\\) 2.2.2 least squares estimators 2.2.3 likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimators 2.2.3.1 Likelihood function P.293 The joint density function of \\(n\\) random variables \\(X_1,...X_n\\) evaluated at \\(x_1, ...x_n\\), say \\(f(x_1,...,x_n; \\theta)\\), is referered to as a likelihood function. 2.2.3.2 Maximum likelihood estimators P.294 Let \\(L(\\theta)=f(x_1,...x_n; \\theta), \\theta \\in \\Omega\\), be the joint pdf of \\(X_1, ..., X_n\\). For a given set of observations, \\((x_1,...x_n)\\), a value \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) in \\(\\Omega\\) at which \\(L(\\theta)\\) is a maximum is called a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of \\(\\theta\\). That is \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is a value of \\(\\theta\\) that satisfies \\[f(x_1,...x_n; \\theta)=MAX_{\\theta \\in \\Omega} f(x_1, ..., x_n; \\theta)\\] 2.2.4 Invariance property of MLEs P.296 If \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the MLE of \\(\\theta\\) and if \\(u(\\theta)\\) is a function of \\(\\theta\\), then \\(u(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is an MLE of \\(u(\\theta)\\). Example 1: We know that the \\(pdf\\) of exponential distribution (\\(X \\sim EXP (\\theta)\\)) is as follows: \\[\\frac{1}{\\theta} e^{-\\frac{X}{\\theta}}\\] Thus, its likelihood function is as follows \\[L(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta^n}e^{-\\frac{\\sum X_i}{\\theta}}\\] Thus, log-likelihood is as follows. \\[lnL(\\theta)=-n ln(\\theta)-\\frac{\\sum X_i}{\\theta}\\] Thus, \\[\\frac{d}{d\\theta} lnL(\\theta)=-n \\frac{1}{\\theta}+\\frac{\\sum X_i}{\\theta^2}\\] Thus, we can get the \\(MLE\\) for \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\hat{\\theta}=\\bar{x}\\). If we want to estimate \\(\\tau(\\theta)=P(X \\geq 1)\\): \\[\\tau(\\theta)=P(X\\geq 1)=\\int_1^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\theta} e^{-\\frac{X}{\\theta}} dx=-\\int_1^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{X}{\\theta}} d(-\\frac{x}{\\theta})=-[e^{-\\frac{X}{\\theta}}]_1^{\\infty}=-[0-e^{-\\frac{1}{\\theta}}]=e^{-\\frac{1}{\\theta}}\\] Thus, based on the invariance property, we know that the \\(MLE\\) for \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) is as follows. \\[e^{-\\frac{1}{\\bar{x}}}\\] Example 2: MLE vs. MME P.296 Assume a random sample from a two-parameter exponential distribution, \\(X_i \\sim EXP(1,\\eta)\\). Thus, the \\(pdf\\) is \\(e^{-(x-\\eta)}\\). Thus, the likelihood function is \\[L(\\eta)=e^{-\\sum(x_i-\\eta)}\\] Thus, the log likelihood, \\[lnL(\\eta)=-\\sum(x_i-\\eta)=n\\eta-n\\bar{X}\\] Thus, we know that as \\(\\eta\\) increases, the log likelihood increases accordingly. Thus, we want to find the maximum \\(\\eta\\). Note that a two-parameter exponential distribution has the support of \\(x_i \\geq \\eta\\). Thus, all \\(\\eta\\) are smaller than any \\(X_i\\). Thus, we can get the ML estimator is the first order statistic \\[\\hat{\\eta}=X_{1:n}\\] Note that the estimators above is based on ML. What would be the answer if using MME? We know that for a two-parameter exponential distribution, its mean is \\(\\mu=1+\\eta\\). And, we know that based on MME, \\(\\mu=\\bar{X}\\). Thus, we can get the following, \\[\\hat{\\eta}=\\bar{X}-1\\] Conclusion We can see that ML and MME have didferent estimators for the same \\(\\eta\\) for a two-parameter exponential distribution. 2.2.5 Unbiased estimators An estimator \\(T\\) is said to be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) if \\[E(T)=\\tau(\\theta)\\] for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). Otherwise, we said that \\(T\\) is biased stimator of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\). For instance, if we want to estimate a percentile, say the 95th percentile of \\(N(\\mu,9)\\). Note that the percentiles that we know are about standardized noraml (i.e., \\(N(0,1)\\)). Thus, we need to have some calculation to get the non-standard one. \\[\\frac{X_{95 \\; percentile}-\\mu}{\\sigma}=1.645\\] Thus, we can get \\[X_{95 \\; percentile}=1.645 \\times \\sigma +\\mu\\] We know that \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the unbiased estimate for \\(\\mu\\). Thus, we can get \\[X_{95 \\; percentile}=1.645 \\times \\sigma +\\mu=4.94+\\mu\\] We know that \\[E(T)=E(\\bar{X}+4.94)=\\mu+4.94\\] Thus, \\(T=\\bar{X}+4.94\\) is the unbiased estimator of \\(\\tau(\\mu)=\\mu+4.94\\). 2.2.6 Unbiased estimators vs. Invariance property of MLEs Do not apply “Invariance property of MLEs” to the Unbiased estimators. ( Note that: You can apply the Invariance property to “Unbiased estimators” when it is a linear combination. In that case, \\(E(a\\theta+b)=aE(\\theta)+b\\). Thus, if you find a \\(T\\) that is a unbiased estimator for \\(\\theta\\), it should be unbiased estimator for \\(a\\theta+b\\) as well. Thus, note that \\(\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\) is not a linear combination of \\(\\theta\\), thus \\(\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\) has a very different estimator, compared to \\(\\theta\\).) P.303 For example, consider a random sample of size \\(n\\) from an exponential distribution, \\(X_i \\sim EXP(\\theta)\\), with parameter \\(\\theta\\). We know that, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is unbiased for \\(\\theta\\) (which is the mean of an exponential distribution). If we want to estimate \\(\\tau(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\), then by the invariance property of MLE is \\(T_1=\\frac{1}{\\bar{X}}\\). However, \\(T_1\\) is a biased estimators of \\(\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\). Specifically, We know that if \\(X \\sim Gam(\\theta,k)\\), then \\(Y=\\frac{2X}{\\theta} \\sim x^2(2k)\\). We know that exponential distributions are a specicial case of Gamma distribution, \\(EXP(\\theta)=Gam(\\theta,1)\\), thus we get the following, \\[Y=\\frac{2n\\bar{X}}{\\theta}=\\frac{2n}{\\theta} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2X_i}{\\theta}\\sim\\sum_{i=1}^n x^2(2\\cdot1)=\\sum_{i=1}^n x^2(2)=x^2(2n)\\] We further know that if \\(Y \\sim x^2(v)\\), \\(E(Y^r)=2^r\\frac{\\Gamma(v/2+r)}{\\Gamma(v/2)}\\). Thus, we know that, \\[E(Y^{-1})=2^{-1} \\frac{\\Gamma(2n/2-1)}{\\Gamma(2n/2)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{n-1}\\] Thus, \\[E(Y^{-1})=E(\\frac{\\theta}{2n \\bar{X}})=\\frac{\\theta}{2n}E(\\frac{1}{\\bar{X}})=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{n-1}\\] Thus. \\[E(\\frac{1}{\\bar{X}})=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\frac{n}{\\theta}=\\frac{n}{n-1}\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\] Thus, \\[E(\\frac{n-1}{n} \\frac{1}{\\bar{X}})=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\] Conclusion: \\(\\frac{1}{\\bar{X}}\\) is not the unbiased estimator for \\(\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\). However, we can adjust it to \\(\\frac{n-1}{n} \\frac{1}{\\bar{X}}\\), which is the unbiased estimator for \\(\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\). When the sample size is big enough, we know that \\(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\) will be close to 1. 2.2.7 UMVUE and Cramer-Rao lower bound 2.2.7.1 UMVUE Let \\(X_1, X_2,...,X_n\\) be a random sample of size \\(n\\) from \\(f(x; \\theta)\\). An estimator \\(T^*\\) of \\(\\tau (\\theta)\\) is called a uniformly minimum variance ubiased estimator (UMVUE) of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) if \\(T^*\\) is unbiased for \\(\\tau (\\theta)\\). For any other unbiased estimator \\(T\\) of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), \\(Var(T^*) \\leq Var(T)\\) for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). 2.2.7.2 Cramer-Rao lower bound If \\(T\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), then the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), based on a random sample, is \\[Var(T)=\\frac{[\\tau^{&#39;}(\\theta)]^2}{nE[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} ln f(X; \\theta)]^2}\\] Example: Consider a random sample from an exponential distribution, \\(X_i \\sim Exp(\\theta)\\). Because \\[f(x; \\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta} e^{-\\frac{x}{\\theta}}\\] Thus, \\[ln(f(x;\\theta))=-\\frac{x}{\\theta}-ln \\theta\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} ln(f(X; \\theta))=\\frac{X}{\\theta^2}-\\frac{1}{\\theta}=\\frac{X-\\theta}{\\theta^2}\\] Thus, \\[E[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} ln(f(X; \\theta))]^2 =E[\\frac{(X-\\theta)^2}{\\theta^4}]=\\frac{1}{\\theta^4}E(X-\\theta)^2=\\frac{1}{\\theta^4} Var(X)=\\frac{\\theta^2}{\\theta^4}=\\frac{1}{\\theta^2}\\] Thus, the CRLB for \\(\\tau(\\theta)=\\theta\\) is as follows. \\[Var(T) \\geq \\frac{[\\tau^{&#39;}(\\theta)]^2}{nE[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} ln f(X; \\theta)]^2}=\\frac{[\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\theta}\\theta]^2}{n \\frac{1}{\\theta^2}}=\\frac{1^2}{\\frac{n}{\\theta^2}}=\\frac{\\theta^2}{n}\\] We know that the variance for the sample mean of the exponential distribution: \\[Var(\\bar{X})=\\frac{Var(X)}{n}=\\frac{\\theta^2}{n}\\] In addition, we also know that sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the unbiased estimator for population mean. Thus, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the UMVUE of \\(\\theta\\). 2.2.8 Best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE or MVLUE) https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/gauss-markov-theorem-ols-blue/ The Gauss-Markov theorem states that if you linear regression satisfies the first 6 classical assumption, the Ordinary least squares (OLS) produces unbiased estimates that have the smallest variable of all possible linear estimators. The Gauss-Markov theorem famously states that OLS is (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) BLUE. In this context, best refers to the minimum variance. MULUE: Minimum Variance Linear Unbiased Estimate https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.2991/978-94-91216-83-1_13 2.2.9 Consistency, asymptotic unbiasedness Simple consistency: P.311 Let \\(\\{T_n\\}\\) be a sequence of estimators of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\). These estimators are said to be consistent estimators of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) if for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt;0\\), \\[lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}P[|T_n-\\tau(\\theta)|&lt;\\varepsilon]=1\\] for every \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). In the terminology of Chapter 7, \\(T_n\\) converges stochastically to \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), \\(T_n \\xrightarrow{P} \\tau(\\theta)\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Sometimes this also is referred to as simple consistency. One interpretation of consistency is that for large sample size the estimator tends to be more concentrated about \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), and by making \\(n\\) sufficiently large \\(T_n\\) can be made as concentrated as desired. MSE consistency: If \\(\\{ T_n \\}\\) is a sequence of estimator of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), then they are called mean squared error consistent if \\[lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} E[T_n - \\tau(\\theta)]^2=0\\] for every \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). Asymptotic Unbiased A sequence \\(\\{ T_n \\}\\) is said to be asymptotically unbiased for \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) if \\[lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} E(T_n)=\\tau(\\theta)\\] for every \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). Example: P.313 For a sample from \\(X_i \\sim EXP(\\theta)\\), we know that \\(T_n=1/ \\bar{X}\\) is an MLE estimator for \\(\\tau(\\theta)=1/\\theta\\). Howwever, \\(T_n\\) is not a unbiased estimator for \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), as \\[E(T_n)=\\frac{n}{n-1}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\] We also know that \\[Var(T_n)=\\frac{(\\frac{n}{n-1})^2}{(n-2)\\theta^2}\\] Thus, while \\(T_n\\) is not unbiased, it is asymptotically unbiased and MSE consistent for \\(\\tau(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\). Note that, MSE consistency is a stronger property than simple consistency. Thus, if a sequenc \\(\\{T_n\\}\\) is mean squared error consistent, it is also simply consistent. 2.2.10 Efficiency P.308 The relative efficiency of an unbiased estimator \\(T\\) of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) to another unbiased estimator \\(T^*\\) of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) is given by \\[re(T, T^*)=\\frac{Var(T^*)}{Var(T)}\\] An unbiased estimator \\(T^*\\) of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) is said to be efficient if \\(re(T, T^*) \\leq 1\\) for all unbiased estimators \\(T\\) of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), and all \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). The efficiency of an unbiased estimator \\(T\\) of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) is given by \\[e(T)=re(T, T^*)\\] if \\(T^*\\) is an efficient estimator of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\). Thus, an effecient estimator is just a UMVUE. Example: P.233 Example 7.2.2 P.303 Example 9.3.2 P.309 Example 9.3.7 Let \\(X_1,X_2,...,X_n\\) sample from \\(X_i \\sim EXP(\\theta)\\). We know that \\[X_{1:n}=EXP(\\theta/n)\\] Thus, \\[E(nX_{1:n})=nE(X_{1:n})=n\\frac{\\theta}{n}=\\theta\\] Thus, \\[nX_{1:n}\\] is the unbiased estimator for \\(\\theta\\). Thus, \\[re(T,T^*)=\\frac{Var(T^*)}{Var(T)}=\\frac{Var(\\bar{X})}{Var(nX_{1:n})}=\\frac{\\theta^2/n}{n^2Var(X_{1:n})}=\\frac{\\theta^2/n}{n^2(\\theta/n)^2}=\\frac{\\theta^2/n}{\\theta^2}=\\frac{1}{n}\\] Thus, \\(T^*=\\bar{X}\\) is a more efficient estimator for \\(\\theta\\) than \\(T=nX_{1:n}\\). 2.2.11 Asymptotic efficiency Let \\(\\{T_n\\}\\) and \\(\\{T_n^*\\}\\) be the two asymptotically unbiased sequences of estimators for \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\). The asymptotic relative efficiency of \\(T_n\\)relative to \\(T_n^*\\) is given by \\[are(T_n,T_n^*)=lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{Var(T_n^*)}{Var(T_n)}\\] The sequence \\(\\{T_n^*\\}\\) is said to asymptotically efficient if \\(are\\{T_n, T_n^*\\} \\leq 1\\) for all other asymptotically unbiased sequences \\(\\{T_n\\}\\), and all \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). 2.2.12 Asymptotic properties of MLEs P.316 If certain regularity conditions are satisfied, then the solutions, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), of the MLE have the following properties: \\(\\hat{\\theta_n}\\) exists and is unique. \\(\\hat{\\theta_n}\\) is a consistent estimator of \\(\\theta\\). \\(\\hat{\\theta_n}\\) is asymptotically normal with asymptotic mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\[\\frac{1}{2}E[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}ln \\; f(X;\\theta)]^2\\] \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is asymptotically efficient. Note that the asymptotic efficiency of \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) follows from the fact that the asymptotic variance is the same as the CRLB for unbiased estimators of \\(\\theta\\). Thus, for large \\(n\\), approximately \\[\\hat{\\theta_n} \\sim N(\\theta, CRLB)\\] Example P.317 From Example 9.2.7, we know the MLE of the mean \\(\\theta\\) of an exponential distribution is the sample mean, \\(\\hat{\\theta_n}=\\bar{X}\\). We can infer the same asymptotic properties either from the discussion above or from the Central Limit Theorem. That is, \\(\\hat{\\theta_n}\\) is asymptotically normal with asymptotic mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(\\theta^2/n\\). From example 9.3.4, we know that \\(CRLB=\\theta^2/n\\). Thus, \\[\\sqrt{n}\\frac{\\hat{\\theta_n}-\\theta}{\\theta}\\sim N(0,1)\\] 2.3 Sufficient and completeness 2.3.1 Sufficiency and minimal sufficiency P.335 Sufficient statistic: A statistic \\(S\\) will be consiered a “sufficient” statistic for a parameter \\(\\theta\\) if the conditional distribution of any other statistic \\(T\\) given the value of \\(S\\) does not involve \\(\\theta\\). Jointly sufficient statistics: Let \\(X=(X_1,...,X_n)\\) have joint pdf \\(f(x,\\theta)\\), and let \\(S=(S_1,...,S_k)\\) be a k-dimensional statistic. Then, \\(S_1,...,S_k\\) is a set of jointly sufficient statistics for \\(\\theta\\) if for any other vector of statistics, \\(T\\), the conditional pdf of \\(T\\) given \\(S=s\\), denoted by \\(f_{T|s}(t)\\), does not depend on \\(\\theta\\). In the one-dimension case, we simply say that \\(S\\) is a sufficient statistic for \\(\\theta\\). If \\(k\\) unknown parameters are present in the model, then quite often there will exist a set of \\(k\\) sufficient statistics. In some cases, the number of sufficient statistics will exceed the number of parameters. Minimal sufficient: A set of statistics is called a minimal sufficient set if the members of the set are jointly sufficient for the parameters and if they are a function of every other set of jointly sufficient statistics. In other words, once the value of a sufficient statistic is known, the observed value of any other statistic does not contain any further inforamtion about the parameter. Example: P.339 Assume a random sample from an exponential distribution, \\(X_i \\sim EXP(\\theta)\\). It follows that \\[f(x_1,...,x_n; \\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta^n} e^{-\\frac{\\sum X_i}{\\theta}}\\] which suggests checking the stastic \\(S=\\sum X_i\\). We know that \\(S \\sim GAM(\\theta,n)\\), thus \\[f_S(s; \\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta^n \\Gamma(n)}s^{n-1}e^{-\\frac{s}{n}}\\] If \\(s=\\sum x_i\\), then, \\[\\frac{f(x_1,...,x_n; \\theta)}{f_S(s;\\theta)}=\\frac{\\Gamma(n)}{s^{n-1}}\\] which is free of \\(\\theta\\), and thus by definition S is sufficient for \\(\\theta\\). 2.3.2 Neyman factorization theorem, minimal sufficiency of MLEs Factorization criterion: If \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) have joint pdf \\(f(x_1,...,x_n; \\theta)\\), and if \\(S=(S_1,...,S_n)\\), then \\(S_1,...,S_k\\) are joinly sufficient for \\(\\theta\\) if and only if \\[f(x_1,...x_n; \\theta)=g(s;\\theta)h(x_1,...,x_n)\\] where \\(g(s;\\theta)\\) does not depend on \\(x_1,...,x_n\\), except through \\(s\\), and \\(h(x_1,...,x_n)\\) does not involve \\(\\theta\\). Example 1: P.340 \\(X_i \\sim Bin(1,\\theta)\\). We can use factorization criterion to check its sufficient statistic. \\[f(x_1,...,x_n;\\theta)=\\theta^{\\sum x_i}(1-\\theta)^{n-\\sum x_i}=\\theta^s(1-\\theta)^{n-s}=g(s;\\theta)h(x_1,...,x_n)\\] where \\(s=\\sum X_i\\) and \\(h(x_1,...x_n)=1\\). Thus, \\(s\\) is sufficient for \\(\\theta\\). Example 2: It is important to specify the regions of zero probability. The following shows that care must be exercised in this matter. P.340 \\(X_i \\sim UNIF(0,\\theta)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is unknown. We get the joint \\(pdf\\) of \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) is \\[f(x_1,...x_n; \\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta^n}\\] where, \\[0&lt;x_i&lt;\\theta\\] It is easier to specify this \\(pdf\\) in terms of the minimum, \\(x_{1:n}\\), and maximum, \\(x_{n:n}\\), of \\(x_1,...,x_n\\). In particular, \\[0&lt; x_{1:n} \\; \\; x_{n:n} &lt;\\theta\\] Thus, \\(x_{n:n}\\) is sufficient for \\(\\theta\\). Example 3: P.341 Consider a random sample from a normal distribution, \\(X_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). We know the \\(pdf\\) for normal is \\[f=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 }} e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu)^2}\\] Thus, the joint \\(pdf\\) is as follows. \\[\\begin{aligned} f(x_1,...,x_n;\\mu,\\sigma^2) &amp;=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum (x_i-\\mu)^2} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum (x_i^2+\\mu^2-2x_i\\mu)} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\sum x_i^2+n\\mu^2-2\\mu\\sum x_i)} \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, \\(S_1=\\sum X_i\\) and \\(S_2=\\sum X_i^2\\) are jointly sufficient for \\(\\theta={\\mu, \\sigma^2}\\). Note that, P.341 based on P.298 , Example 9.2.10, ML estimation results in \\[\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{x}\\] \\[\\hat{\\sigma^2}=\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n}\\] Further, note that \\[\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{x}=\\frac{S_1}{n}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\sigma^2}&amp;=\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n}=\\frac{\\sum (x_i^2+\\bar{x}^2-2x_i\\bar{x})}{n} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{\\sum x_i^2+n\\bar{x}^2-2\\bar{x} \\sum x_i}{n} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{\\sum x_i^2+n\\bar{x}^2-2n\\bar{x}^2}{n} \\\\&amp;=\\frac{\\sum x_i^2-n\\bar{x}^2}{n} \\\\&amp;=\\frac{\\sum x_i^2}{n}-\\bar{x}^2 \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{\\sum x_i^2}{n}- (\\frac{\\sum x_i}{n})^2 \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{S_2}{n}-(\\frac{S_1}{n})^2 \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, we can see that \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma^2}\\) correspond to a one-to-one stransformation of \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\), thus \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma^2}\\) also are jontly sufficient for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). 2.3.3 Rao-Blackwell theorem Let \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) have joint \\(pdf \\; f(x_1,...,x_n; \\theta)\\), and let \\(S=(S_1,...,S_k)\\) be a vector of jointly sufficient statistics for \\(\\theta\\). If \\(T\\) is any unbiased estimator of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), and if \\(T^*=E(T|S)\\), then \\(T^*\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), \\(T^*\\) is a function of \\(S\\), and \\(Var(T^*) \\leq Var(T)\\) for every \\(\\theta\\), and \\(Var(T^*) &lt; Var(T)\\) for some \\(\\theta\\) unless \\(T^*=T\\) with probability 1. Discussion: P.345 \"It is clear from the Rao-Blackwell theorem that if we are searching for an unbiased estimator with small variance, we may as well restrict attention to function of sufficient statistics. If any ubiased estimator exists, then there will be one that is a function of sufficient statistics, namely \\(E(T|S)\\), which also is unbiased and has variance at least as small or smaller. In particular, we still are interested in knowing how to find a UMVUE for a parameter, and the above theorem narrows our problem down somewhat. For instance, consider a one-parameter model \\(f(x;\\theta)\\), and assume that a single sufficient statistic, \\(S\\), exists. We know that we must consider only unbiased functions of \\(S\\) in searching for a UMVUE. In some cases it may be possible to show that only one function of \\(S\\) is unbiased, and in that case we would know that it is a UMVUE. The concept of “completeness” is helpful in determinning unique unbiased estimators, and this concept is defined in the next section.\" 2.3.4 completeness Completeness: P.345 A family of density functions \\(\\{ f_T(t,\\theta); \\theta \\in \\Omega\\}\\), is called complete if \\(E[u(T)]=0\\) for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\) implies \\(u(T)=0\\) with probability 1 for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega\\). P.345 “This sometimes is expressed by saying that there are no nontrivial unbiased estimators of zero. In particular, it means that two different functions of \\(T\\) cannot have the same expected value.” For example, if \\(E[u_1(T)]=\\tau(\\theta)\\) and \\(E[u_2(T)]=\\tau(\\theta)\\), which implies \\(u_1(T)-u_2(T)=0\\), or \\(u_1(T)=u_2(T)\\) with probablity 1, if the family of density fucntions is complete. That is, any unbiased estimator is unique in this case. We mainly are interested in knowing that the family of density functions of a sufficient statistic is complete, because in that case an unbiased function of the sufficient statistic will be unique, and it must be a UMVUE by the Rao-Blackwell theorem. 2.3.5 Lehmann-Scheffe completeness theorem Let \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) have joint \\(pdf \\; f(x_1,...,x_n; \\theta)\\) and let \\(S\\) be a vector of jointly complete sufficient statistics for \\(\\theta\\). If \\(T^*=t^*(S)\\) is a statistic that is unbiased for \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\) and a function of \\(S\\), then \\(T^*\\) is a UMVUE of \\(tau(\\theta)\\). Example: P.346 2.3.6 Exponential class, complete sufficient statistics A density fucntion is said to be a member of the regular exponential class if it can be expressed in the form \\[f(x; \\theta)=c(\\theta)h(x)e^{\\sum_{j=1}^k q_j(\\theta)t_j(x)}\\] where, \\[x \\in A\\] And zero otherwise, where \\(\\theta=(\\theta_1,...,\\theta_k)\\) is a vector of \\(k\\) unknown parameters, if the parameter space has the form \\[\\Omega=\\{\\theta | a_i \\leq \\theta_i \\leq b_i, i=1,...k\\}\\] (note that \\(a_i=-\\infty\\) and \\(b_i=\\infty\\) are permissible values), and if it satisfies regularity conditions 1, 2, and 3a or 3b given by: The set \\(A=\\{x:f(x; \\theta)&gt;0\\}\\) does not depend on \\(\\theta\\). The functions \\(q_j(\\theta)\\) are nontrivial, functionally independent, continuous fucntion of the \\(\\theta_i\\). 3a. For a continuous random variable, the derivatives \\(t_k^{&#39;}(x)\\) are linearly independent continous functions of \\(x\\) over \\(A\\). 3b. For a discrete random variable, the \\(t_k(x)\\) are nontrivial functions of \\(x\\) on \\(A\\), and none is a linear function of the others. Example P.348 Consider Bernoulli distribution \\(X \\sim Bin(1,p)\\). It follows that \\[\\begin{aligned} f(x; p) &amp;=p^x(1-p)^{1-x} \\\\ &amp;=P^x(1-p)(1-p)^{-x} \\\\ &amp;=(1-p)(1-p)^{-x}P^x \\\\&amp;=(1-p)e^{ln(1-p)^{-x}P^x} \\\\ &amp;=(1-p)e^{xln(\\frac{p}{1-p})} \\end{aligned}\\] Compared to the definition of Exponential Class defined above, we can get the following. \\[c(\\theta)=(1-p)\\] \\[h(x)=1\\] \\[q_1(\\theta)=ln(\\frac{p}{1-p})\\] \\[t_1(x)=x\\] Theorem 10.4.2 P.348 If \\(X_1,...,X_n\\) is a random sample from a member of the regular exponential class \\(REC(q_1,...,q_k)\\), then the statistics \\[S_1=\\sum_{i=1}^n t_1(X_i),...,S_k=\\sum_{i=1}^n t_k(X_i)\\] are a minimal set of complete sufficient statistics for \\(\\theta_1,...\\theta_k\\). Example 1: P.348 Again, consider Bernoulli distribution \\(X \\sim Bin(1,p)\\). For a random sample of size \\(n\\), \\(t(x_i)=x_i\\) and thus based on Theorem 10.4.2 (see above) \\(S=\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) is a complete sufficient statistic for \\(p\\). How about we want to find UMVUE for \\(Var(X)=p(1-p)\\)? We might try \\(\\bar{X}(1-\\bar{X})\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} E[\\bar{X}(1-\\bar{X})] &amp;=E(\\bar{X})-E(\\bar{X}^2) \\\\ &amp;=p-(p^2+var(\\bar{X})) \\\\ &amp;=p-p^2-\\frac{p(1-p)}{n} \\\\ &amp;=p(1-p)(1-\\frac{1}{n}) \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, \\[E[\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{n}}\\bar{X}(1-\\bar{X})]=p(1-p)\\] Thus, \\(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{n}}\\bar{X}(1-\\bar{X})\\) is the UMVUE of the \\(p(1-p)\\). but why? Example 2: P.349 If \\(X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), then \\[\\begin{aligned} f(x;\\mu,\\sigma)&amp;=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x^2+\\mu^2-2x\\mu)} \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}-\\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2}+\\frac{x\\mu}{\\sigma^2}} \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, \\(S_1=\\sum X_i^2\\) and \\(S_2=\\sum X_i\\) are jointly complete and sufficient statistics of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). Refer to the normal example in the section of “Neyman factorization theorem, minimal sufficiency of MLEs” Theorem 10.4.3 P.349 If a CRLB estimator \\(T\\) exists for \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\), then a single sufficient statistic exists, and \\(T\\) is a function of the sufficient statistic. Conversely, if a single sufficient statistic exists and teh CRLB exists, then a CRLB estimator exists for some \\(\\tau(\\theta)\\). "],

In addition, we typically assume that this is under the GLM framework and thus we also assume that the residuals follow normal distribution. 3.2.1 Least squares and propoerties of the regression parameters 3.2.1.1 Basic idea Of note The following method can always calculate the vector of \\(\\beta\\), not related to any specific methods. \\[Y_{n \\times 1}=X_{n\\times m}\\beta_{m \\times 1}\\] \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\[[X^T]_{m \\times n}Y_{n \\times 1}=[X^T]_{m \\times n}X_{n\\times m}\\beta_{m \\times 1}\\] \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\[[X^TX]^{-1}_{m\\times m}[X^TY]_{m \\times 1}=\\beta_{m \\times 1}\\] \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\[\\beta_{m \\times 1}=[(X^TX)^{-1} \\cdot (X^TY)]_{m \\times 1}\\] Thus, \\[Var(\\hat{\\beta})=(X^TX)^{-1}X^T \\cdot \\sigma^2 \\cdot [(X^TX)^{-1}X^T]^T\\] Residual is given by \\(e_i\\), which is an estimate of \\(\\varepsilon_i\\). Properties of the residuals \\(e_i\\) : The mean of resituals should be \\(0\\). The variance of \\(e_i\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} Var(e) &amp;=Var(Y-X\\hat{\\beta}) \\\\ &amp;=Var(Y-X(X^TX)^{-1}X^TY) \\\\ &amp;=Var(I-X(X^TX)^{-1}X^T)Y \\\\&amp;=(I-X(X^TX)^{-1}X^{T})\\sigma^2 \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, \\[Var(e) \\neq \\sigma^2\\] 3.2.1.2 Least Squares Assume the following model: \\[Y=X\\beta +\\varepsilon\\] When \\(\\beta\\) only has a dimension of \\(2 \\times 1\\), we can write it as follows. \\[Y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_i +\\varepsilon\\] Thus, \\[Q=\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1X_i)^2\\] We can calculate the partial derivates as follows. \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_0} Q \\rightarrow \\sum_{i=1}^n [Y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1X_i]=0\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_1} Q \\rightarrow \\sum_{i=1}^n [Y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1X_i]X_i=0\\] Combining the two pieces of information, we can get \\[b_1=\\frac{\\sum(X_i-\\bar{X})(Y_i-\\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X_i-\\bar{X})^2}\\] \\[b_0=\\frac{1}{n}(\\sum Y_i-b_1\\sum X_i)=\\bar{Y}-b_1\\bar{X}\\] Properties of Least Squares Estimators (Gauss- Markov theorem): P.18 Under the conditions of regression model shown above, the least squares estimator \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are unbiased and have minimum variance among all unbiased linear estimators. That is, \\[E(b_0)=\\beta_0\\] \\[E(b_1)=\\beta_1\\] Point Estimation of Mean Response: Given sample estimators \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) in the regression function \\[E\\{Y\\}=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X\\] We estimate the regression function as follows: \\[\\hat{Y}=b_0+b_1X\\] We call a value of the response variable a response and \\(E\\{Y\\}\\) the mean response. Propoerties of fitted regression line P.22 The resitual: \\[e_i=Y_i-\\hat{Y_i}\\] The sum of the residuals is zero \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i=0\\] 3.2.1.3 Point estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) Note that, there are two \\(S^2\\) below, and they have different formulus, even though the only difference is the degree of freedom and the logic of calculating df is the same across these two cases (i.e., Single Population vs. Regression Model ). 1. Single Pupulation Sum of squares: P.25 \\[\\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\\bar{Y})^2\\] The sum of squares is then divided by the degrees of freedom associated with it. \\[S^2= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}\\] \\(S^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The sample variance \\(S^2\\) is often called a mean square, because a sum of squares has been divided by the appropriate number of degrees of freedom. \\[E(S^2)=\\sigma^2\\] 2. Regression model Sum of Squares Error (SSE) (or, Sum of Squares Residual): \\[SSE=\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\\hat{Y_i})^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2\\] Mean Square Error (MSE) (or, Mean Square Residual): \\[S^2=MSE=\\frac{SSE}{n-2}=\\frac{\\sum(Y_i-\\hat{Y_i})^2}{n-2}=\\frac{\\sum e_i^2}{n-2}\\] \\(MSE\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) for regression model. \\[E(MSE=S^2)=\\sigma^2\\] 3.2.2 MLE P.30 Note that the Normal Error Regression Model is as follows. \\[Y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_i +\\varepsilon\\] (This is a special case of the definition provided earlier, i.e., \\(Y=X\\beta +\\varepsilon\\)) For this model, each \\(Y_i\\) observation is normally distributed with mean \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i\\) and a standard devision \\(\\sigma\\).

We have three ways to find a solution \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) and the orthogonal projection \\(\\hat{Y}\\): 1. Reducing the model to the full rank. Let \\(X_1\\) consist of \\(r\\) linear independent columns from \\(X\\) and let \\(X_2\\) consistn of the remaining columns. Then, \\(X_2=X_1F\\) because the columns of \\(X_2\\) are linearly dependent on the columns of \\(X_1\\). \\[X=(X_1, X_2)=(X_1, X_1F)=X_1[I_{r\\times r}, F]\\] This is a special case of the factorization \\(X=KL\\), where rank \\((K_{n \\times r})=r\\) and rank \\((L_{r\\times p})=r\\). \\[E[Y]=x\\beta=KL\\beta=k\\alpha\\] Since \\(K\\) has full rank, the Least Squares Estimate of \\(\\alpha\\) is \\(\\hat{\\alpha}=(K^T K)^{-1} \\cdot K^TY\\). The orthogonal project, \\[\\hat{Y}=K\\cdot \\alpha=K \\cdot(K^T K)^{-1} \\cdot K^TY=X_1 \\cdot(X_1^TX_1)^{-1}\\cdot X_1^TY\\] \\[\\begin{bmatrix} Y_{11} \\\\ ... \\\\ Y_{1n_1} \\\\ Y_{21} \\\\ ... \\\\ Y_{2n_2} \\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ ... &amp; ... &amp; ... \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ ... &amp; ... &amp; ... \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp;1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}+\\begin{bmatrix} \\varepsilon_{11} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\varepsilon_{1n_1} \\\\ \\varepsilon_{21} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\varepsilon_{2n_2} \\end{bmatrix}\\] Let \\(X_1\\) consist of the first 2 columns of \\(X\\), then \\[X=X_1 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\] Thus, \\[X_1=K=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ ... &amp; ... \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ ... &amp; ... \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[\\hat{\\alpha}=(K^T K)^{-1} \\cdot K^TY=\\begin{bmatrix} n &amp; n_1 \\\\ n_1 &amp; n_1 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\begin{bmatrix} \\sum Y_{1j}+\\sum y_{2j} \\\\ \\sum y_{1j} \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{Y_2}\\\\ \\bar{Y_1}-\\bar{Y_2} \\end{bmatrix}\\] \\[\\hat{Y}=X_1 \\hat{\\alpha}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ ... &amp; ... \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ ... &amp; ... \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{Y_2}\\\\ \\bar{Y_1}-\\bar{Y_2} \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{Y_1} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\bar{Y_1} \\\\ \\bar{Y_2} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\bar{Y_2} \\end{bmatrix}\\] 2. Find the generalized inverse \\((X^TX)^{-1}\\). As noted above, when \\(X^TX\\) has a full rank, we can directly calculate the inverse of \\(X^TX\\). That is, \\[\\beta_{m \\times 1}=[(X^TX)^{-1} \\cdot (X^TY)]_{m \\times 1}\\] We can just find some columns within \\(X\\) that are independent, and then calculate the inverse of it. This is because if a matrix \\(W\\) with a rank \\(r\\) and can be partitioned as follows. \\[W=\\begin{bmatrix} A &amp; B \\\\ C &amp; D \\end{bmatrix}\\] Assume \\(A\\) has rank \\(r\\), then \\[W^{-1}=\\begin{bmatrix} A^{-1} &amp;0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\] Thus, let \\(X=(X_1, X_2)\\), where \\(X_1\\) consists of \\(r\\) linearly independent columns from \\(X\\). Then a generalized inverse of \\(X^TX\\) is \\[[X^TX]^{-1}=\\begin{bmatrix} [X_1^TX_1]^{-1}&amp;0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\] Thus, all other steps are similar to the full rank case. 3. Impose identififiability constraints (Not very sure this one.) 3.4 Assumptions, checking assumptions The following are some of the possible violations of assumptions: 3.4.1 Regression function is nonlinear Plot explanatory and response variables to see whether their relationship is linear, it is not, suggesting that a linear regression function is not appropriate. Stat Methods: F-test for lack of fit. 3.4.2 Non-constant variance Plots of the residuals against the predictor variable (i.e., \\(X\\)) or against the fitted values (i.e., \\(\\hat{Y}\\)), to study whether the linear model is appropriate and whether the variance of the error terms is constant. Stat Methods: (1) Modified Levene’s test (Brown-Forsythe test): To check and see if the variability for \\(Y\\) for the smaller \\(X&#39;s\\) are different than the vairability of \\(Y\\) for the larger \\(X&#39;s\\). Thus, we can break up the data into two groups based \\(X&#39;s\\) values. Then, we test to see if the vairability of these two groups significantly differ. Note that Modefied Levene’s test does not depend on normality of the error terms. That is, this test is robust against serious departures from normality. (2) Breusch-Pagan test: Want to see if there is any relationship between \\(\\sigma_i\\) and the \\(X_i\\)’s. To do this, we can fit a regression of \\(log(\\sigma_i)\\) on \\(X_i\\)’s: \\[log(\\sigma_i)=b_0+b_1X_i\\] 3.4.3 Error terms not independent We want a random pattern. Any type of pattern indicates time orderred problems indicates that the model is not appropriate. Stat Methods: Durbin Watson Test Test for presence of autocorrelation amongst observations. 3.4.4 Possibility of outliers Scatter plot the dependent variable and independent variables (each \\(X_i\\) is plotted seprately.) 3.4.5 Non normal distribution of error Use histogram to check whether the resitual follows normal distribution. Stat Methods: P.115 Correlation between ordered residuals and their expected values under normality. P.70 512 note You can use Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling in SAS to assess the normal errors. 3.4.6 Omission of some of the important predictors Plots should be made betweeen variables omitted from the model and the dependent variable. Such omitted variables may have important effects on the response. 3.5 Bootstrapping used in linear models P.458 Intro For standard fitted regression models, methods described earlier chapters are available for evaluating the precision of estimated regression coefficients, fitted values, and predictions of new observations. However, in many nonstandard situations, such as when nonconstant error variance are estimated by iteratively reweighted least sqaure or when robust regression estimation is used, standard methods for evaluating the precision may not be available or may only approximately applicable when the sample size is large. Bootstrapping was developed by Efron to provide estimates of the precision of sample estimates for these complex cases. Conceptual Suppose that we have fitted a regression model (simple or multiple) by some procedure and get the coefficient \\(b_1\\). We now wish to evaluate the precision of this esimtate by bootsrap method. In essensce, the bootstrap method call for the selection from the observed sample data of a random sample of size \\(n\\) with replacement. Next, the bootstrap method calculates the estimated regression coefficient from the boostrap sample, using the same fitting procedure as employed for the original fitting. This leads to the first bootstrap estimate \\(b_1^*\\). This procedure repeated a large number of times, each time a bootstrap sample of size \\(n\\) is selected with replacement from the original sample and the estimated coefficient is obtained. The estimated standard deviation of all the bootstrap estimates \\(b_1^*\\) denoted by \\(S^*\\{b_1^*\\}\\), is an estimate of the variability of the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\) and therefore a measure of the prevision of \\(b_1\\). Some Math Bootstrapping sampling for regression can be done in two basic ways. Whne the regression fucntion being fitted is a good model for the data, the error terms have constant variance, and the predictor variables can be regarded as fixed, fixed X sampling is appropriate. Here, the resitudals \\(e_i\\) from the original fitting are regarded as the sample data to be sampled with replacement. After bootstrap sample of the resituals of size n have beeb obtained, denoted by \\(e_1^*, ..., e_n^*\\). The bootstrap sample residuals are added to the fitted values from the original fitting to obtain nuew bootstrap Y values, denoted by \\(Y_1^*,...,Y_n^*\\): \\[Y_i^*=\\hat{Y_i}+e_i^*\\] These bootstrap \\(Y^*\\) values are then regressed on the original \\(X\\) variables by the same procedure used initially to obtain the bootstrap estimate \\(b_1^*\\). When there is some doubt about the adequacy of the regressio nmodel, or the rror variances are not constant, or the predictor variables can not be regarded as fixed, random X sampling is appropriate. For simple regression, the pair \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) data in the oringal sample are considered to be the data to be sampled with replacedment. This this second procedure samples cases with replacement $n times, yelding a bootstrap sample of \\(n\\) pairs of (\\(X^*,Y^*\\)) values. This bootstrap sample is then used for obtaining the bootstrap estimate \\(b_1\\), as with fixed \\(X\\) sampling. Bootstrap confidence intervals P.460 3.6 Generalized linear models 3.6.1 Definition, similarities and differences from general linear models Generalized Linear Model (GLiM) loosens this assumption that \\(\\varepsilon\\) follows a mutivariate normal distribution, and allows for a variety of other distributions from the exponential family for the residuals. Of note, the GLM is a special case of the GLiM in which the distribution of the residuals follow a conditionally normal distribution. 3.6.2 Advantage and disadvantages 3.6.3 logistic and poisson regression Logistic regression Logistic regression is a special case of GLiM with binomial distribution on the \\(Y&#39;s\\) and the link function The basic idea of logistic regression: \\[p(y=1)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n)}}=\\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}}\\] Thus, \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n\\) can be from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\), and \\(p(y=1)\\) will be always within the range of \\((0,1)\\). f&lt;-function(x){exp(x)/(1+exp(x))} data&lt;-seq(-10,10,1) plot(data,f(data),type = &quot;b&quot;) We can also write the function into another format as follows: \\[log \\frac{p(y=1)}{1-p(y=1)}= \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n\\] Thus, we know that the regression coeficients of \\(\\beta_i\\) actually change the “log-odds” of the event. Of course, note that the magnitude of \\(\\beta_i\\) is dependent upon the units of \\(x_i\\). "],

A factor is fixed if its levels are selected by a non-random process or if its levels consist of the entire population of possible levels. 4.1.2 Crossed vs. Nested A factor, A, is said to be crossed with respect to a second factor, say B, if each level of factor A is exactly the same for each level of factor B, and each level of factor B is exactly the same for each level of factor A. Otherwise, the factor is said to be nested. A factor, say B, is nested within another factor, say A, if the levels of factor B are not the same across all levels of factor A. 4.2 Completely randomized designs Completely random design (CRD): Randomly select 9 farms. Randomly assign 3 farms to Variety 1, 3 farms to Variety 2, and 3 farms to Variety 3. This arrangement might appear as in the following table. CRD All experimental units (i.e., 9 farms) are randomly assigned to all treatment (i.e., 3 varieties) and therefore the design is a CRD design. That is, across all experimental units, (i.e., 9 farms) they are assumed to be homogeneous before getting the assigned treatments. 4.3 Randomized complete block designs Randomized complete block design (RCBD): Randomly select 3 farms. Each farm is divided into 3 subunits with all three varieties, and all 3 varities are randomly assigned into the 3 subunits. RCBD The \\(t\\) treatments are randomly assigned to the \\(t\\) subunits within each block. Thus, there are t-treatments, with each to be observed b times (i.e., \\(t \\times b\\) experimental units). In the table above, t-treatments are the 3 varities, whereas b times are the 3 blocks. Thus, 3 farms are the 3 blocks. This is a Randomized Complete Block Design. That is, we have a one-way treatment structure (Variety) in a randomized complete block design structure. We call the farms blocks or blocking factor. Note that block and treatment (Variety) are crossed. 4.4 Row-column design (Latin square designs) ( My own short summary: Latin Square Designs basically are a double-block design.) Randomly select 3 farms and divide each farm into 3 subunits with all three Varieties to be assigned to each farm. In addition, suppose that these farms have fertility gradients (high, medium and low). The treatments are assigned so that each farm (row) receives all three Varieties, but so does each fertility (column) level. LSD This is a Latin Square Design. That is, we have blocked both on rows (farms) and columns (fertility) such that each treatment occurs once, and only once, within a row or column (e.g., a block). 4.5 Comparing RCBD versus CRD When is it to use RCBD or CRD more efficient? If there is “substantial” amount of variation in the units of replications (i.e., blocks for RCBD; replicats for CRD), then the block design is more efficient and has higher power than CRD. In contrast, if the variation among units of replication is small, CRD is more efficient and has more power than RCBD. 4.6 Incomplete block designs 512 P. 293 These designs are similar to the RCBD except that each block (e.g., each farm) contains fewer than \\(t\\) units and thus, only a portion of the \\(t\\) treatments are applied to the units within each block. (e.g., not all the farms will get all the varieties of wheat). 4.7 Split-plot designs ( My own short summary: The split-plot design is a bit similar to Latin Square Designs, but not exactly the same.) Consider a completely randomized design with a one-way treatment structure. In this case, suppose the treatment structure consists of 3 variteis of wheat (\\(V_1,V_2,V_2\\)), each planted on 4 randomly selected farms. RCD2 The ANOVA table for this experiment would appear as follows. As shown, farms are nested within Variety. As we can see, we do not need to model specifically the variety within each farm. Whole Plot and Treatment Structure RCD2_ANOVA However, now suppose that the researcher is also interested in the effect of two different fertilizers (\\(F_1, F_2\\)) on yield. The completely randomized design can be modified by __splitting__each farm in half. In this experiment, there are two different sizes of experimental units: the large units, which are the farms and the small units, which are the Farm Halves (i.e., fertility levels).

Suppose that we flip a coin 20 times and observe 8 heads. We can use the R’s glm function to esimate the \\(\\rho\\). If the result is consistent with what we did above, we should observe that the \\(cdf\\) of the esimate of \\(\\beta_0\\) (i.e., intercept) should be equal to \\(8/20=0.4\\). coins&lt;-c(rep(1,times=8),rep(0,times=12)) table(coins) ## coins ## 0 1 ## 12 8 coins&lt;-as.data.frame(coins) 7.2.1 Probit probitresults &lt;- glm(coins ~ 1, family = binomial(link = &quot;probit&quot;), data = coins) probitresults ## ## Call: glm(formula = coins ~ 1, family = binomial(link = &quot;probit&quot;), ## data = coins) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) ## -0.2533 ## ## Degrees of Freedom: 19 Total (i.e. Null); 19 Residual ## Null Deviance: 26.92 ## Residual Deviance: 26.92 AIC: 28.92 pnorm(probitresults$coefficients) ## (Intercept) ## 0.4 As we can see the intercept is \\(-0.2533\\), and thus \\(\\Phi(-0.2533471)=0.4\\) 7.2.2 Logit We can also use logit link to calculate the intercept as well. Recall that \\[p(y=1)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n)}}=\\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}}\\] Thus, \\[p(y=1)=\\frac{e^{\\beta_0}}{1+e^{\\beta_0}}\\] logitresults &lt;- glm(coins ~ 1, family = binomial(link = &quot;logit&quot;), data = coins) logitresults$coefficients ## (Intercept) ## -0.4054651 exp(logitresults$coefficients)/(1+exp(logitresults$coefficients)) ## (Intercept) ## 0.4 Note that, the defaul link for the binomial in the glm function in logit. 7.3 Further on logit The probablity of \\(y=1\\) is as follows: \\[p=p(y=1)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n)}}=\\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}}\\] Thus, the likelihood function is as follows: \\[L=\\prod p^{y_i}(1-p)^{1-y_i}=\\prod (\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n)}})^{y_i}(\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}})^{1-y_i}\\] \\[=\\prod (1+e^{-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n)})^{-y_i}(1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n})^{-(1-y_i)}\\] Thus, the log-likelihood is as follows: \\[logL=\\sum (-y_i \\cdot log(1+e^{-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n)})-(1-y_i)\\cdot log(1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+...+\\beta_nx_n}))\\] Typically, optimisers minimize a function, so we use negative log-likelihood as minimising that is equivalent to maximising the log-likelihood or the likelihood itself. #Source of R code: https://www.r-bloggers.com/logistic-regression/ mle.logreg = function(fmla, data) { # Define the negative log likelihood function logl &lt;- function(theta,x,y){ y &lt;- y x &lt;- as.matrix(x) beta &lt;- theta[1:ncol(x)] # Use the log-likelihood of the Bernouilli distribution, where p is # defined as the logistic transformation of a linear combination # of predictors, according to logit(p)=(x%*%beta) loglik &lt;- sum(-y*log(1 + exp(-(x%*%beta))) - (1-y)*log(1 + exp(x%*%beta))) return(-loglik) } # Prepare the data outcome = rownames(attr(terms(fmla),&quot;factors&quot;))[1] dfrTmp = model.frame(data) x = as.matrix(model.matrix(fmla, data=dfrTmp)) y = as.numeric(as.matrix(data[,match(outcome,colnames(data))])) # Define initial values for the parameters theta.start = rep(0,(dim(x)[2])) names(theta.start) = colnames(x) # Calculate the maximum likelihood mle = optim(theta.start,logl,x=x,y=y, method = &#39;BFGS&#39;, hessian=T) out = list(beta=mle$par,vcov=solve(mle$hessian),ll=2*mle$value) } mydata = read.csv(url(&#39;https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv&#39;)) mylogit1 = glm(admit~gre+gpa+as.factor(rank), family=binomial, data=mydata) mydata$rank = factor(mydata$rank) #Treat rank as a categorical variable fmla = as.formula(&quot;admit~gre+gpa+rank&quot;) #Create model formula mylogit2 = mle.logreg(fmla, mydata) #Estimate coefficients print(cbind(coef(mylogit1), mylogit2$beta)) ## [,1] [,2] ## (Intercept) -3.989979073 -3.772676422 ## gre 0.002264426 0.001375522 ## gpa 0.804037549 0.898201239 ## as.factor(rank)2 -0.675442928 -0.675543009 ## as.factor(rank)3 -1.340203916 -1.356554831 ## as.factor(rank)4 -1.551463677 -1.563396035 7.4 References http://www.columbia.edu/~so33/SusDev/Lecture_9.pdf "],
